## Overview

### The challenge 

#### Objectives

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

#### Solution

When I made the solution I focused on the three breakpoints provided with the mockup:

- Desktop: 1440px
- Tablet: 768px
- Mobile: 375px

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
My knowledge towards CSS positioning has been reinforced during this project in terms of when to use relative and when to use absolute positioning. 

I learned that I personally don't like the mobile-first workflow. I find it a lot easier to do the desktop version and work my way down. 
After some research I realise desktop-first can be a lot of work when having to figure out which features is needed for the tablet and especially mobile versions - but with a mockup such as what frontendmentor provided I don't have to decide which features are important.

### Continued development
There are many good reasons to go mobile-first one being I can possibly save some time on a lot of redundant code and I will definately give it try with the next solution I make.

I will also try and make the solutions more responsive and not just follow the three breakpoitns provided in the challenges.
